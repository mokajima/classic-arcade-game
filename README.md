## How to play

In this game you have a Player and Enemies (Bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies. The player can move left, right, up and down by pressing arrow keys. The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene. Once the player collides with an enemy, the player lose one of the three lives and moves back to the start square. Once the player reaches the water, the game goes to next level.
